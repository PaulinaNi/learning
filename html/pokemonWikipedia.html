    <h2>History</h2>
    <p> In 1998, Nintendo spent $25 million promoting Pokémon in the United States in partnership with Hasbro, KFC, and
    others.[14] Nintendo initially feared that Pokémon was too Japanese for Western tastes but Alfred Kahn, then CEO of
    4Kids Entertainment convinced the company otherwise.[15] The one who spotted Pokémon's potential in the United States
    was Kahn's colleague Thomas Kenney.[16] </p>
    <p>In November 2005, 4Kids Entertainment, which had managed the non-game related licensing of Pokémon, announced that
    it had agreed not to renew the Pokémon representation agreement. The Pokémon Company International oversees all
    Pokémon licensing outside Asia.[17] In 2006, the franchise celebrated its tenth anniversary and release Pokémon
    Diamond and
    Pearl.[18] In 2016, the Pokémon Company celebrated Pokémon's 20th anniversary by airing an ad during Super Bowl 50 in
    January and re-releasing the first Pokémon video games 1996 Game Boy games Pokémon Red, Green (only in Japan), and
    Blue, and the 1998 Game Boy Color game Pokémon Yellow for the Nintendo 3DS on February 26, 2016.[19][20] The mobile
    augmented reality game Pokémon Go was released in July 2016.[21] Pokémon Sun and Moon also released in the same year.
    The first live-action film in the franchise, Pokémon Detective Pikachu, based on the 2018 Nintendo 3DS spin-off game
    Detective Pikachu, was released in 2019.[22] The eighth generation of core series games began with Pokémon Sword and
    Shield, released worldwide on the Nintendo Switch on November 15, 2019.</p>
    <p>To celebrate its 25th anniversary, the company released two additional titles for the Nintendo Switch: Pokémon
    Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, remakes of the Nintendo DS Pokémon Diamond and Pearl games, on November 19,
    2021, and its "premake" Pokémon Legends: Arceus, which was subsequently released on January 28, 2022.[23][24]</p>
    <p> Pokémon Scarlet and Violet began the ninth generation of the game series when they released worldwide for the
    Nintendo Switch on November 18, 2022.[25]</p>

    <h2>Name</h2>
    <p>The name "Pokémon" is a syllabic abbreviation of the Japanese brand Pocket Monsters.[26] The term "Pokémon", in
    addition to referring to the Pokémon franchise itself, also collectively refers to the many fictional species that
    have made appearances in Pokémon media. "Pokémon" is identical in the singular and plural, as is each individual
    species name; it is and would be grammatically correct to say "one Pokémon" and "many Pokémon", as well as "one
    Pikachu" and "many Pikachu".[27]</p>

    <h2>Concept</h2>
    <p>See also: Gameplay of Pokémon, List of Pokémon, and Pokémon universe</p>
    <h3>Gameplay</h3>
    <p>Pokémon executive director Satoshi Tajiri first thought of Pokémon, albeit with a different concept and name,
    around 1989, when the Game Boy was released. The concept of the Pokémon universe, in both the video games and the
    general fictional world of Pokémon, stems from the hobby of insect collecting, a popular pastime which Tajiri enjoyed
    as a child.[28] Players are designated as Pokémon Trainers and have three general goals: to complete the regional
    Pokédex by collecting all of the available Pokémon species found in the fictional region where a game takes place, to
    complete the national Pokédex by transferring Pokémon from other regions, and to train a team of powerful Pokémon
    from those they have caught to compete against teams owned by other Trainers so they may eventually win the Pokémon
    League and become the regional Champion. These themes of collecting, training, and battling are present in almost
    every version of the Pokémon franchise, including the video games, the anime and manga series, and the Pokémon
    Trading Card Game (also known as TCG).</p>
    <p>In most incarnations of the Pokémon universe, a Trainer who encounters a wild Pokémon has the ability to capture
    that Pokémon by throwing a specially designed, mass-producible spherical tool called a Poké Ball at it. If the
    Pokémon is unable to escape the confines of the Poké Ball, it is considered to be under the ownership of that
    Trainer. Afterwards, it will obey whatever commands it receives from its new Trainer, unless the Trainer demonstrates
    such a lack of experience that the Pokémon would rather act on its own accord. Trainers can send out any of their
    Pokémon to wage non-lethal battles against other Pokémon; if the opposing Pokémon is wild, the Trainer can capture
    that Pokémon with a Poké Ball, increasing their collection of creatures. In Pokémon Go, and in Pokémon: Let's Go,
    Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!, wild Pokémon encountered by players can be caught in Poké Balls, but most cannot be
    battled. Pokémon already owned by other Trainers cannot be captured, except under special circumstances in certain
    side games. If a Pokémon fully defeats an opponent in battle so that the opponent is knocked out ("faints"), the
    winning Pokémon gains experience points and may level up. Beginning with Pokémon X and Y, experience points are also
    gained from catching Pokémon in Poké Balls. When leveling up, the Pokémon's battling aptitude statistics ("stats",
    such as "Attack" and "Speed") increase. At certain levels, the Pokémon may also learn new moves, which are techniques
    used in battle. In addition, many species of Pokémon can undergo a form of metamorphosis and transform into a similar
    but stronger species of Pokémon, a process called evolution; this process occurs spontaneously under differing
    circumstances, and is itself a central theme of the series. Some species of Pokémon may undergo a maximum of two
    evolutionary transformations, while others may undergo only one, and others may not evolve at all. For example, the
    Pokémon Pichu may evolve into Pikachu, which in turn may evolve into Raichu, following which no further evolutions
    may occur. Pokémon X and Y introduced the concept of "Mega Evolution," by which certain fully evolved Pokémon may
    temporarily undergo an additional evolution into a stronger form for the purpose of battling; this evolution is
    considered a special case, and unlike other evolutionary stages, is reversible.</p>
    <p>In the main series, each game's single-player mode requires the Trainer to raise a team of Pokémon to defeat many
    non-player character (NPC) Trainers and their Pokémon. Each game lays out a somewhat linear path through a specific
    region of the Pokémon world for the Trainer to journey through, completing events and battling opponents along the
    way (including foiling the plans of an evil team of Pokémon Trainers who serve as antagonists to the player).
    Excluding Pokémon Sun and Moon and Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, the games feature eight powerful Trainers,
    referred to as Gym Leaders, that the Trainer must defeat in order to progress. As a reward, the Trainer receives a
    Gym Badge, and once all eight badges are collected, the Trainer is eligible to challenge the region's Pokémon League,
    where four talented trainers (referred to collectively as the "Elite Four") challenge the Trainer to four Pokémon
    battles in succession. If the trainer can overcome this gauntlet, they must challenge the Regional Champion, the
    master Trainer who had previously defeated the Elite Four. Any Trainer who wins this last battle becomes the new
    champion.</p>
    <h3>Pokémon universe</h3>
    <p>Pokémon is set in the fictional Pokémon universe. There are numerous regions that have appeared in the various
    media of the Pokémon franchise. There are 9 main series regions set in the main series games: Kanto, Johto, Hoenn,
    Sinnoh/Hisui, Unova, Kalos, Alola, Galar, and Paldea. Each of the nine generations of the main series releases
    focuses on a new region. Every region consists of several cities and towns that the player must explore in order to
    overcome many waiting challenges, such as Gyms, Contests and villainous teams. At different locations within each
    region, the player can find different types of Pokémon, as well as helpful items and characters. Different regions
    are not accessible from one another at all within a single game, only with the exception of Kanto and Johto being
    linked together in Pokémon Gold, Silver, Crystal, HeartGold and SoulSilver versions. There are also regions set in
    spinoff games and two islands in the Pokémon anime (Orange Islands and Decolore Islands), all still set within the
    same fictional universe.</p>
    <p>Each main series region in the Pokémon universe is based on a real world location. The first four regions
    introduced are based off of locations in Japan, being Kantō, Kansai, Kyushu, and Hokkaidō, with later regions being
    based on parts on New York City, France, Hawaii, the United Kingdom, and the Iberian Peninsula.[29][30]</p>

    <h3>Generations</h3>
    <p>All of the licensed Pokémon properties overseen by the Pokémon Company International are divided roughly by generation. These generations are roughly chronological divisions by release; every several years, when a sequel to the 1996 role-playing video games Pokémon Red and Green is released that features new Pokémon, characters, and gameplay concepts, that sequel is considered the start of a new generation of the franchise. The main Pokémon video games and their spin-offs, the anime, manga, and trading card game are all updated with the new Pokémon properties each time a new generation begins.[31] Some Pokémon from the newer games appear in anime episodes or films months, or even years, before the game they were programmed for came out. The first generation began in Japan with Pokémon Red and Green on the Game Boy. As of 2022, there are nine generations of main series video games. The most recent games in the main series, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet began the ninth and latest generation when they released worldwide for the Nintendo Switch on November 18, 2022.[32][33][34]</p>
